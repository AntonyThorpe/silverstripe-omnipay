# 3.0 (WIP)

## Changelog
 * Upgraded codebase for SilverStripe 4.0
 * Changed how logging works ([documentation](../en/Logging.md))
 * Changed `Payment::generateUniquePaymentIdentifier` from public to protected, as it's an internal API
 * Removed the setters/getters for httpClient and httpRequest on the `Payment` class. These were only used for Unit-Testing 
 * Moved the `Helper` class to the `Helper` namespaced and renamed to `ErrorHandling`. Also moved the `PaymentMath` class to `Helper` and added a `Logging` helper class.
