# Responsibilities

There are three different code bases to consider:

 * Application - your SilverStripe application that you want to include payment in.
 * Payment Module - this module. Handles SilverStripe integration.
 * Omnipay Framework - gateway interaction handling.

Your application is responsible for:
* Configuration of payment gateways, via YAML.
* Providing system data
    * amount
    * currency
    * return/cancel urls
* Providing customer data (depending on gateway requirements)
    * name
    * address for billing/shipping
    * credit card details
* Linking one, or many payments to the thing you want to pay for.

This payment module is responsible for:
* Providing a few models to store payment state, and history in
* Handling responses from external gateways
* Integrating with omnipay

The omnipay library is responsible sending requests to the gateway servers, and parsing responses in to a consistent format.
