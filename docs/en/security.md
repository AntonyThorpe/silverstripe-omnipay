Credit card details should never fall into the wrong hands! Be safe.

You should:

 * Become familiar with standard SilverStripe security measures, and implement where possible.
 * Use SSL security whenever there is a payment-related form.
 * Make the PaymentGatewayController use SSL.

## On-site vs Off-site gateways

Offsite gateways are a less risky way to get set up to take payments. This is because the responsibility of taking care of credit card details remains with them, as it is captured on their external web page.
