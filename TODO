Issues to resolve:

 * Handling different gateway features
 * What should happen on failure?
 * Should form fields be provided? Could provide fields for data that is not already provided, and is requred by gateway.
 * Provide the option to either authorise + capture, or to do both at once.

 TODO:

 * Test actual gateways
 * i18n integration
 * error handling
 * model integration
