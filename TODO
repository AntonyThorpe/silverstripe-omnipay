Issues to resolve:

 * Handling different gateway features
 * What should happen on failure?
 * Should form fields be provided? Could provide fields for data that is not already provided, and is requred by gateway.
 * Provide the option to either authorise + capture, or to do both at once.

 TODO:

 * Test actual gateways
 * i18n integration
 * error / exception handling
 * model integration
 * provide a credit card entry form / page for on-site payments
 Only allow setting amount when payment status is 'Created'. Ie...introduce futher immutability.


 Validate credit card details for gateways that take them.
